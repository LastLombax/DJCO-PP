## MIEICrawler: First Semester Edition

_MIEICrawler_ is a 2D dungeon crawler game, in which the player must pass on each subject from the first semester of MIEIC.

The game is composed by five levels, one of each subject of the first semester, and a main room where the player can choose the level to play and upgrade their skills.

### Skills
The player has access to three main skills: 

* A throwing glass of beeer;
* A mouse cursor that bounces between players;
* A cup of hot coffee that, when thrown, it spills and leaves an area of damage per second.

The player also has a sword for close range damage.

### Gameplay

The player moves with WASD and controls the direction of the character with the mouse. Each skill can be used with the keys _1_, _2_ or _3_. To swing the sword, press _MOUSE1_.


### Levels

Each level has a boss at the end and each boss is challenged with a Fight or a Puzzle.
